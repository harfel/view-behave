# view-behave

Display JSON outputs from python behave. Generate report files with
```python
$ behave -f json -o report.json
```

Then, open report.json in view-behave to get a nice rendition of your BDD test
report. view-behave.html is a single-file static HTML/JS solution that does
not require any installation or server to run. Just download the file or use
it online at https://harfel.github.io/view-behave/
